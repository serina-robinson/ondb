Urea
Urea is constantly being released into the environment as a component of mammalian detoxification products; many other species excrete uric acid which is subsequently degraded to urea (Mobley & Hausinger 1989). Urea is used globally as a fertilizer to provide nitrogen, which is degraded through urease and converted to ammonia and carbon dioxide (Tabatabai & Bremner 1972). The enzyme urease can also drive calcium precipitation by lowering pH and producing carbonate, so that calcium ions precipitate as calcium carbonate (Krajewska 2018). Given urea&#8217;s water-solubility, it is prone to soil leaching and can lead to ecosystem imbalance such as heightened pH through ammonia release. Urea is toxic to unaccustomed cattle at 0.3-0.5 g/kg, is a mild human eye irritant (Pubchem). Urea can contain biuret as an impurity, which is a known phytotoxin (Sahrawat 1976). U.S. aggregated product volume in 2016 was estimated to be 20,000,000,000-30,000,000,000 lbs (Pubchem).

<b>Enzymes</b> <br> <u>Urease (urea amidohydrolase) E.C. 3.5.1.5</u> <br> This enzyme is present in many plants (especially <i>Leguminosae</i>) and bacterial species. It is a nickel-dependent enzyme (Mulrooney & Hausinger 2003). It is recognized as having a high substrate affinity (Amtul, Z. et al. 2002) and has various modes of regulation (Mobley & Hausinger 1989). The enzyme can play a prominent role in bacterial pathogenesis (Cox et al. 2000, Mobley & Hausinger 1989). Kandeler, Stemmer & Klimanek found that farmyard manure stimulated urease activity while NPK (mixture of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) did not (1999). A design containing urease in microshells, into which urea can enter but urease cannot leave, has been created (Lvov et al. 2001). Mobley & Hausinger have created a review of microbial ureases, which can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372718/pdf/microrev00040-0097.pdf <br> <br> <u>Urea Carboxylase (Kanamori et al. 2004) E.C. 6.3.4.6</u> <br> Urea carboxylase produces allophanate and requires ATP as a cofactor. In yeast the enzyme “urea amidolyase” catalyzes the same reaction, being composed of biotin carboxylase, urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase activities; it is referenced as E.C. 3.5.1.4.5. (Hausinger 2004).  Some bacteria, such as Oleomonas sagarenensis, possess both urease and urea carboxylase, creating multiple pathways for urea degradation. Explanations proposed include alternate pathways for substrate abundance, cofactor abundance or multiple enzyme functions. <i>Nitrosobacter</i> sp appear to have urea carboxylases (as well as allophanate hydrolases) (Koch et al. 2015). The reaction it catalyzes is: <br> urea + ATP + HCO<sub>3</sub> &#8594; allophanate + ADP + P<sub>i</sub> (Veaudor, Cassier-Chauvat & Chauvat 2019).
