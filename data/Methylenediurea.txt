Methylenediurea

Methylenediurea is the smallest urea-aldehyde condensation product in the polymer family collectively referred to as methylene ureas (ureaform) and provides bioavailable nitrogen more readily than other ureaform derivatives (Jahns et al. 2003, Hayes and Haden 1969). Methylenediurea is a water-soluble slow-release fertilizer with an EPA estimated U.S. aggregated product volume ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 lbs in 2016 (PubChem). The compound may be sold with a coating, such as a polymer, gel, or organic material to alter the release time of nitrogen into the soil. Methylenediurea is classified as an irritant according to GHS classification (PubChem). <br> <br> Plant ureases do not degrade methylenediurea (Koivunen et al. 2003), but bacteria are capable of degrading methylenediurea. It has been noted that the enzyme involved, methylendiurase, has distinctly different properties and degrading capabilities between bacterial species (Jahns and Kaltwasser 2000, Jahns, Ewen and Kaltwasser 2003). Organic acids, such as are produced by fungi during carbohydrate metabolism, may allow for a non-enzymatic degradation of methylenediurea (Jahns and Kaltwasser 2000).

<b>Enzyme</b> <br> <u>Methylenediurease</u> <br> (Note: multiple enzymes with different characterizations have been labeled the same enzyme. Below is a general overview followed by bacteria-specific examinations of each). <br> <br> The enzyme that degrades methylenediurea, methylenediurease (also known as methylenediurea deiminase, sometimes spelled methylenediurea deaminase) is a hydrolase with the enzyme classification E.C. 3.5.3.21, and catalyzes the following reaction: <br> <br> H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>0 + methylenediurea &#8594; 2NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + N-(hydroxymethyl)urea + CO<sub>2</sub> (Jahns et al. 1997, Jahns and Kaltwasser 2000). <br> <br> It is thereafter decomposed to formaldehyde and urea, which Jahns et al. suggests is a nonenzymatic process (1997). The enzyme is one of nine nickel-containing enzymes known (Mulroony and Hausinger 2003), has not been structurally characterized but appears to be somewhat similar to urease (Ibid.), another nickel-containing enzyme. <br> <br> <u>Methylenediurease in <i>Ochrobactrum anthropi</i> (Jahns et al. 1998, Jahns, Schepp and Kaltwasser 1997)</u> <br> <i>O. anthropi</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that has been detected in sludge and soil. The enzyme also referred to as methylenediurea amidohydrolase, is a homotetramer (molecular mass 140 &#177 25 kDa, subunits 38 &#177 5 kDa each). It uses induction by methylenediurea and different fractions of ureaform as its mode of regulation. The enzyme degrades methylenediurea, methylenetriurea, and higher-polymerized methyleneureas. Inhibitors for the enzyme have been identified by Jahns, Schepp, and Kaltwasser (1997). Preliminary experiments suggest that it is a periplasmic enzyme in <i>Ochrobactrum anthropi</i>; this would be understandable, given the expected high impermeability of methylenediurea across the cell membrane. <br> <br> <u>Methylenediurease in <i>Ralstonia paucula</i> (Jahns and Kaltwasser 2000)</u> <br> The enzyme is a tetramer with the structure &#945;2&beta;2 (molecular mass approx. 166 kDa, subunits 25 and 63 kDa). It uses presence of ammonia for repression/derepression and degrades dimethylenediurea, methylenetriurea and higher-polymerized methyleneureas. <br> <br> <u>Methylenediurease in <i>Burkholderia</i> sp.: (Jahns, Ewen and Kaltwasser 2003)</u> <br> Enzyme is a tetramer with the structure &#945;2&beta;2 (molecular mass approx. 189 kDa) regulated through repression by ammonium and induction by methyleneureas. It degrades both methylendiurea and methylenetriurea. Notably, the enzyme was separated from urease in the same organism, each directed to their respective substrates (Mulrooney and Hausinger 2003). The enzyme was found containing <q>residues corresponding to all of the ligands of the urease dinuclear Ni active site.</q> (Ibid.) <br> <br> <u>Methyleneurease in <i>Rhizobium radiobacter</i> (Koivunen et al. 2003)</u> <br> This enzyme is classified as a mehtyleneurease rather than an methylenediurease. It weighs 180 &#177 20 kDa, with units of 32, 34 and 62 kDa. The mode of regulation is induction by methylenurea, and it has high substrate affinity for all the major forms of cold water-soluble methyleneurea. The enzyme can also hydrolyze urea at 20&#37; of its rate of methyleneurea degradation. Ammonium and formaldehyde are produced at a 2:1 ratio.
