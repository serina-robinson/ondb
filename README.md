The learning curve for R can be steep, but it is an incredible useful skill! Here we provide a curated collection of online resources for learning R. We used a combination of these resources in our undergraduate summer research project to build the Organonitrogen Biodegradation Database web application using R and R Shiny (code provided here). Due to the specialized focus on that application making the exact code (availble in this repository) unlikely to be generalizable, we provide the resources below for new users seeking to learn R for their own applications:
